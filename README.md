# Sound modulation instability

This project consists in the sound representation of optic modulation instability. To produce the sound, we used [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), an open source software created by Sam Aaron to create and perform music by writing code.

## What is modulation instability



## Music representation of modulation instability

We want to represents scientific data using sound. Scientific data of modulation instability is usually represented with pictures. Here we want to try something different: depicting simulation data using sound. The dynamic aspect of sound fits nicely with the wave.
